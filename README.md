# Mental-Health-Text-Mining

Individual project for Text and Multimedia Mining course at Radboud University. In this project I investigated language use of people suffering from different mental health conditions and made a comparison between tweets made pre-covid times and during the pandemic. Data was gathered here:

Suhavi, Singh, A., Singh, A. K., Shrivastava, S., Arora, U., Shah, R. R., & Kumaraguru, P. (2022). Twitter-STMHD: An Extensive User-Level Database of Multiple Mental Health Disorders. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6409736

To obtain the results shown in the project run main.py. Not all functions in this repository are used. Functions related to importing the data in chunks and processing the whole dataset can be ignored and are not guarenteed to work. 

Requirements:
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Transformers
